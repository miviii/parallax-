      <h2>Section One</h2>
      <p>
        The Marvel Cinematic Universe is an American media franchise and 
        shared universe centered on a series of superhero films produced by
         Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters that appear in American
          comic books published by Marvel Comics.One of the key factors behind Marvelâ€™s
           cult following is the strength of its characters. Marvel has always been known
            for creating complex, flawed, and relatable heroes and villains. For example,
             the X-Men are a group of mutants who are feared and hated by society because 
             they are different. This storyline has resonated with readers and viewers because
              it reflects real-world issues of prejudice and discrimination.

          Similarly, Spider-Man is a relatable hero who struggles with everyday problems,
           such as balancing his superhero responsibilities with his personal life. This 
           relatability has made him a favorite of younger audiences and has helped him to
            maintain his popularity for over half a century.

      <h2>Section Two</h2>
      <p>
        Marvel has been through a lot of changes over the years and has taken their place atop the 
        superhero mountain.  Since the Silver Age, Marvel has showcased their roster of respected 
        heroes clashing with some of the most intimidating villains of all time in monumental battles.
         Melding Golden Age greats like Captain America and Namor with modern-day titans like the X-Men
          and Spider-Man, Marvel has changed superheroes forever.
        The MCU is a cultural phenomenon, one Marvel has cultivated and nurtured since 2008's Iron Man.
         Even before the Disney acquisition, Marvel was on its way to being the biggest name in superhero 
         cinema and since then have put out the biggest movies ever.

        While the MCU isn't perfect, it has brought superheroes to the masses in a way heretofore unseen
         and became a massive cultural force.

      <h2>Section Three</h2>
      <p>
        The actors in Marvel movies have an impressive dedication to their roles that makes their 
        stories come alive in a way that's engaging, fascinating, and memorable. Whether they're 
        villains, heroes, or a little bit of both, with a large amount of screen time or very little,
         the actors take their roles to amazing heights.In essence, there aren't really any new stories,
          just the same ones told in different ways with new characters. The MCU is among the few who've
           successfully revamped stories that would otherwise feel like a rehash of tired, old tropes and
            created something new and amazing. This is partially thanks to the storytelling technique used 
            as the Redditor Rupee_Roundhouse explained that "Marvel has a radically different approach to
             filmmaking."
